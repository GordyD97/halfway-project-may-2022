    <div classs="text-card">
      <p> My plan is to take this skill of coding and let it give me an income that i can use to help me achive happiness. I reaally want to be able to 
        show that my skills can most certianly pay the bills. There are some things that I want to be able to accomplish in life and those things that sit so near 
        and dear to me in my heart, its a definite that I get these task complete these task consist of:
        <span> 
         <ul>
           <li>building fast and cool cars ex: <ul>
             <li>race car</li>
              <li>drift car</li>
                <li>off road rig</li>
           </ul> </li>
          <li>go and travel the palces that intrest me the most </li>
          <li> have an amazing bike collection.</li>
          <li> be able to create a home for myself with my skillset.</li>
          <li> help local youth sports teams and clubs by giving them small donations and funding their events. </li>
         </ul> 
        </span> so as you can see these goals of mine are why I am doing my best at the moment. I always have something to work for because it is for me. There will always be some fight left in me no matter how down
        I get and no matter how frustrated I am. There will always be something that keeps me going thats the only thing I need. Never quit never stop fighting.
